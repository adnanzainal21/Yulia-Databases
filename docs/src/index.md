# Indicators.jl

[Indicators](https://github.com/dysonance/Indicators.jl) is a Julia package offering efficient implementations of many technical analysis indicators and algorithms. This work is inspired by the [TTR](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/TTR) package in R and the Python implementation of [TA-Lib](https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/), and the ultimate goal is to implement all of the functionality of these offerings (and more) in Julia. This package has been written to be able to interface with both native Julia Array types, as well as the TS time series type from the [Temporal](https://github.com/dysonance/Temporal.jl) package. Contributions are of course always welcome for wrapping any of these functions in methods for other types and/or packages out there, as are suggestions for other indicators to add to the lists below.
